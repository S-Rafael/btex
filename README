btex is yet another (!) LaTeX compiler that grew out of my desire to make
compiling into dvi or ps or pdf quickly.

Installation:
 1. Copy the file btex to a directory which is in your PATH. For instance
    /usr/local/bin.
 2. Copy the files from https://github.com/ppurka/sh_functions to
    a directory which is in your PATH. For instance /usr/local/bin.

Configuration:
 * The first time you run btex, it should create a configuration file as
   $HOME/.config/btex.config
 * You can open that file and set a pdf and/or ps and/or dvi viewer and set
   other options.
 * It is not mandatory to modify or configure the config file. btex will
   run perfectly fine with the default untouched configuration, but you
   will see less options in the menu during the execution of the program.

Usage:
btex can be run simply as if you were running LaTeX with no arguments. For
instance if you are used to running:
$ latex file.tex
then you can simply do
$ btex  file.tex

Via the configuration file, you can set extra options that will be passed
to latex directly. You can also set the default output format by setting
the MODE variable in the configuration file.

Look at btex --help for more information.
